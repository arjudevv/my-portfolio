```

## Server Components

Server Components allow you to fetch data directly in your components without client-side JavaScript:

```tsx
async function BlogPosts() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts').then(res => res.json());
  
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <article key={post.id}>
          <h2>{post.title}</h2>
        </article>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 makes it easier than ever to build fast, scalable web applications. The App Router and Server Components provide a powerful foundation for modern React development.
